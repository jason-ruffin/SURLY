SURLY database
Daniel Lorigan, Jason Ruffin

Installation and Running instructions:

Download all .java files, and the test.txt file or other SURLY command file if desired.

Run 'SURLY.java [inputFilename.txt]' to use the database.
When running, the user can:
- input and run individual SURLY commands on the database;
- save the database model to a save file;
- load a previously saved .sur file;
- use commands from another SURLY command file (such as test.txt);

Type 'exit' when finished to close the database.
